# Introduction to Airship CMS

Airship CMS is a Web Development Platform for building websites and client-side applications. Airship is a flexible, fully-hosted solution with server-side rendering, API, CMS, and eCommerce functionality.

If you are a user that is web-savvy, and likes to manage their own website with drag & drop tools, and lots of configuration and options, Airship CMS is not for you. You might be better off with a large enterprise solution, or a service with UI controls for flexibility. 

If you are a user that is on a budget, AirshipCMS might not be for you.  For DIY solutions take a look at --, --, and --.

We like to think that Airship is for building custom sites. :) Especially when you want to build a custom site, without the hassle of a custom CMS, and without the headache of battling a CMS made for blogging. Airship is especially for building uniquely crafted custom sites and projects, and a developer IS needed in order to exercise the full power of the platform.

If you are someone who is growing your business, and you are focusing on YOUR BUSINESS and expertise, and you are ready to call a developer so you can keep doing what you do, while devs can build something(what we are good at doing!!) then you are ready for Airship. Unlike DIY solutions, the user interface for business owners, shop owners (we know you have very little time!) is simplified and uncluttered. Things should be relatively familiar and hard to break. We keep the technical controls in the hands of the developers. All you have to do is call up your dev, and they can quickly customize your end project to your heart's content. If you are interested in _that_ kind of relationship/project, Airship could be a fit for you :)

Different because we Don't Give you a GUI.
What does Airship provide? A playground for developers to build. Unlike the solutions that exist out there, we _don't_ give you a GUI for drag and drop. Let's be honest... the 4 hours it would take you to "customize your site" will get you close, you will be 75% happy, and you could have used those 4 hours to do whatever your core expertise is... and just pay a web designer or developer to craft your site to your specifications. THat is the kind of relationship we are interested in.
