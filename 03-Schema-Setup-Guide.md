## Schema Setup Guide
Airship Projects consist of [Pages](/documentation/view/pages) (single items with custom properties), [Collections](/documentation/view/collections), and [Relationships](/documentation/view/relationships) that connect data between Pages and Collections.

Before you dive in to build your project in the CMS, it is a good idea to plan the schema for your project. See the [Schema & Data Model](/documentation/view/schema-and-data-model) Docs for more information.
