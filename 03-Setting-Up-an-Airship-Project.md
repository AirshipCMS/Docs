## Airship CMS
Once you start an Airship Project, your Airship CMS Admin Panel URL will be: `(https://subdomain.airshipcms.io/admin)`. _(where "subdomain" is your subdomain)_

Airship Projects consist of [Pages](/documentation/view/pages) (single items with custom properties), [Collections](/documentation/view/collections), and [Relationships](/documentation/view/relationships) that connect data between Pages and Collections.

Before you dive in to build your project in the CMS, it is a good idea to plan the schema for your project. See the [Schema & Data Model](/documentation/view/schema-and-data-model) Docs for more information.

Once you have mapped out your project schema, you can start setting up the Pages and Collections for your project in your project's Airship CMS Admin Portal. For more information, see [Introduction to Airship CMS](/documentation/view/introduction-to-airship-cms) about how to use the CMS.
