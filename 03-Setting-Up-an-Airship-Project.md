## Starting an Airship Project
@jon Grab items #1-4 from Quickstart page and put here.

## Airship CMS
Airship Projects consist of [Pages](/documentation/view/pages) (single items with custom properties), [Collections](/documentation/view/collections), and [Relationships](/documentation/view/relationships) that connect data between Pages and Collections.

To start setting up Pages and Collections, you need to do so in the Airship CMS Admin Portal. For more information, see [Introduction to Airship CMS](/documentation/view/introduction-to-airship-cms).  

If you are ready to start architecting the Schema for your project, see the [Schema & Data Model](/documentation/view/schema-and-data-model) Docs.
