## `airship login`
Logging into a Project (Malia)  

## `airship land`
Landing a Project (Malia)  

`airship land` downloads all server templates and files and replaces your local copies.

## `airship launch`
Launching a Project (Malia)  

`airship launch` uploads all local templates and files and replaces the server copies.

### Not a Replacement for Git
`airship land` and `airship launch` are meant to be publishing and syncing tools only. They do not replace the purpose of a source code management tool. For a typical project, you only need to run airship land once. After that you will just be running airship launch to add changes to your live site.

### Debugging after `airship launch`
If you launched your project and you don't see your changes on the live site, try doing a hard-refresh on the browser for the live site. If that doesn't work, try clearing your browser cache. Your local cache may be very sticky. If that doesn't work either and it has been more than 5 minutes since you have launched your site, there might be some other issue.
