# Development Guide
This development guide is for someone who has completed the [Schema Setup Guide](/documentation/view/schema-setup-guide) and is ready to start developing their site.

Before you can begin developing, make sure you have the Airship CLI Tools installed by navigating to a terminal and running the `airship` command. If you do not have them installed yet, check out the instructions on [Installing the Airship CLI Tools](/documentation/view/install-airship-cli-tools). Once your CLI tools are installed, feel free to briefly look over the available [commands](/documentation/view/airship-cli-commands) that may be used during development.

In order to become more familiar with the development workflow, it might be helpful to review how to [use layouts and templates](/documentation/view/using-layouts-templates), what the [project structure](/documentation/view/project-directory) is like, and how to use Airships [Propeller Helpers](/documentation/view/propeller-helpers) to render your site content.

## Develop Locally @Malia
Once you have set up your schema, you can land the project to pull down new templates and template directories. 

Note: whenever you land that this will overwrite anything you were working on locally so be sure to backup files/use scm tool.

Describe workflow more verbosely and with numbered step headers
- login
- serve
- develop (you might also be running other dev processes. see examples below)
- make backups/commit files
- launch
