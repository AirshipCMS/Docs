## Develop Locally @Malia
Once you have set up your schema, you can land the project to pull down new templates and template directories. 

Note: whenever you land that this will overwrite anything you were working on locally so be sure to backup files/use scm tool.

Describe workflow more verbosely and with numbered step headers
- login
- serve
- develop (you might also be running other dev processes. see examples below)
- make backups/commit files
- launch
