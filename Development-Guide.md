# Development Guide

## Airship CMS
Your Airship CMS Admin Panel URL will be: `(https://subdomain.airshipcms.io/admin)`. _(where "subdomain" is your subdomain)_

Once you have mapped out your project schema, you can start setting up the Pages and Collections for your project in your project's Airship CMS Admin Portal. For more information, see [Introduction to Airship CMS](/documentation/view/introduction-to-airship-cms) about how to use the CMS.
