# Build Uniquely Custom Experiences

[grid of many different projects]

Most websites and web applications have the same backend requirements: Create, Update, and Delete X items in Y collections. Of those collections, variations exist in who has access to view, edit, and delete things.

And that's your basic website or webapp backend, abstracted into pieces of data that are created and managed by users. 90% of these projects will do just fine as Wordpress websites, Shopify stores, and SquareSpace sites, which are industry standard for building blogs and online stores.

However, 10% of those projects might have a really simple backend, with a uniquely custom user experience that won't fit a template you can buy online, or build an app for then patch to an existing CMS. Examples of those unique experiences might be:

[illustrate each]
- a really custom checkout process. where there are a lot of customizations, and all products are managed by the user.
- a complex form, where you have to gather a lot of data and a form-builder just doesn't get you there (or you don't want to spend the time to figure it out).
- something else.

And this is the niche where Airship might be a good fit. It's a platform that allows the developer to scaffold a pretty standard project schema and database infrastructure, then be able to build a uniquely custom frontend.

# Build More Efficiently
Airship CMS is just a small component of Airship, where the power of the platform exists with the developer workflow tools.
Devs can develop faster, QA can review faster, Editors can create content, and the project can be completed more efficiently and cost-effectively. Double your Speed. Once the project schema is completed, the content of the project can be sent off to the content editor to work on, while the developers can work on the functionality. Isn't that better than waiting for the entire project to be completed, _then_ starting on final content?
This doesn't mean that the project is _cheaper_, though it means you can spend more of the bucks building the website and application glamour... the stuff you really want to shine.
