# How to make your Project More [SOMETHING]

[grid of many different projects]

Most websites and web applications have the same backend requirements: Create, Update, and Delete X items in Y collections. Of those collections, variations exist in who has access to view, edit, and delete things.

And that's your basic website or webapp backend, abstracted into pieces of data that can be edited. Let's be honestâ€”90% of these types of projects will do just fine as Wordpress websites, Shopify stores, and SquareSpace sites, which are industry standard for building blogs and online stores.

However. 10% of those projects might have a really simple backend, with a uniquely custom user experience. And such experience won't fit a cookie-cutter model that can be built with one of these solutions. Examples might be:
- a really custom checkout process. where there are a lot of customizations, and all products are managed by the user.
- a complex form, where you have to gather a lot of data and a form-builder just doesn't get you there (or you don't want to spend the time to figure it out).
- something else.

That's the niche where Airship might be a good tool. It's a platform that allows the developer to scaffold a pretty standard project schema and database, then generate build off of that architecture to focus on a unique frontend.





though Airship gives a developer schema creation tools to make it fast to scaffold a project infrastructure.

Airship is more than just a CMS. It is a development and hosting platform that allows a developer to build rapidly, in whatever stack they choose, and nearly any workflow they choose. How does this benefit you? Devs can develop faster, QA can review faster, Editors can create content, and the project can be completed more efficiently and cost-effectively. 
Double your Speed. Once the project schema is completed, the content of the project can be sent off to the content editor to work on, while the developers can work on the functionality. Isn't that better than waiting for the entire project to be completed, _then_ starting on final content?
This doesn't mean that the project is _cheaper_, though it means you can spend more of the bucks building the website and application glamour... the stuff you really want to shine.
