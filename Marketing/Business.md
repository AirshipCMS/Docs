# Create Uniquely Custom Experiences

[grid of many different projects]

Most websites and web applications have the same backend requirements: Create, Update, and Delete X items in Y collections. Of those collections, variations exist in who has access to view, edit, and delete things.

And that's your basic website or webapp backend, abstracted into pieces of data that are created and managed by users. 90% of these projects will do just fine as Wordpress websites, Shopify stores, and SquareSpace sites, which are industry standard for building blogs and online stores.

However, 10% of those projects might have a very standard backend, with a uniquely custom frontend user experience that doesn't quite fit a template you can just buy online or find a plugin for. Examples of those unique experiences might be:

[illustrate each]
- a really custom checkout process. where there are a lot of customizations, and all products are managed by the user.
- a complex form, where you have to gather a lot of data and a form-builder just doesn't get you there (or you don't want to spend the time to figure it out).
- something else.

And this is the niche where Airship might be a good fit. It's a platform that allows the developer to scaffold a pretty standard project schema and database infrastructure, then from the ground up, be able to build a uniquely custom frontend.

# Build More Efficiently
[illustration of bargraphs of time efficiency]
Airship CMS is just a small component of the Airship platform. The full power of working with Airship exists with how the developer workflow is streamlined and decoupled from the end-user experince of content creators.

Once the [Project Schema] is set up, developers can start building, and content creators can start editing. QA Testers can review faster, and the project as a whole can be completed more efficiently and cost-effectively.

You no longer need to wait for an entire custom project to be completed, _then_ handoff to the content editor to write the final copy.

Development isn't _cheaper_, it's more efficient. With time and costs saved, developers can spend more time building the website and application glamour... the stuff you really want to shine.
