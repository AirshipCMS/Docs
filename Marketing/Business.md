# How to make your Project More [SOMETHING]
Of all the projects, 90% of projects have very similar backend requirements: Create, Update, and Delete X items in Y collections. Out of those projects, variations exist in who has permission to view and update things. And that's your basic app backend. There's also the 10% of projects that are much more complex and require a much more custom solution, though
Airship gives a developer schema creation tools to make it fast to scaffold a project infrastructure.

Airship is more than just a CMS. It is a development and hosting platform that allows a developer to build rapidly, in whatever stack they choose, and nearly any workflow they choose. How does this benefit you? Devs can develop faster, QA can review faster, Editors can create content, and the project can be completed more efficiently and cost-effectively. 
Double your Speed. Once the project schema is completed, the content of the project can be sent off to the content editor to work on, while the developers can work on the functionality. Isn't that better than waiting for the entire project to be completed, _then_ starting on final content?
This doesn't mean that the project is _cheaper_, though it means you can spend more of the bucks building the website and application glamour... the stuff you really want to shine.
