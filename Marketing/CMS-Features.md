# Simple, Fully-Hosted Content Management
Content Editor Workspace  When you log in to the Admin Portal, your workspace is clutter-free. You only have access to the tools you need for content editing.

Fully-Hosted  We make it easy to manage content and media. All your assets are hosted on our servers as part of your Airship CMS subscription.

Custom Controls  Airship comes with very few end-user settings. Based on your needs, your web developer can create custom controls for components specific to your project.

Familiar Interface  Content Editors will feel comfortable transitioning to Airship from similar content management software.

Image & Video Management  Airship utilizes Cloudinary to resize and optimize images and videos hosted on a secure content delivery network.

Users & Authentication  Authentication is handled by Auth0. Users can sign in with a social media account, or create a username and password.

Data Types & Lists  Airship allows you to store links, text, or media in lists so that content editors have the ability to add one or many units of content to a page.

eCommerce  Create a Stripe account and link to Airship via Stripe Connect to enable ordering, subscriptions, and product management with Airship CMS.
