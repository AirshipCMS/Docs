# Fits Your Developer Workflow
We built Airship because we needed a better workflow. We were using Wordpress as a headless CMS for some projects, though the flow was disjointed.

Airship is a CMS builder. You can craft your backend not just work with it.

## Developer Tools
[Airship CMS for superadmins.]
Schemas are created in the GUI, because they are directly tied to editable content fields. As a superadmin, you have access to controls that determind fileds and layouts. Content Creators cannot change anything "dangerous".

[local development]
Most other work is done locally with Airship CLI and in your text editor. serve content from the database.

[use your frontend tools]
Angular whatever output to compartments.

[launch]
launch. fully hosted, no maintenance needed. no updates needed. no babysitting the server.
