# Why Go Fully Hosted?

## Server Maintenance

Server side code needs to be updated regularly. This can be a nightmare for agencies hosting client sites, or your managing the app for your startup. Airship handles security updates and unobtrusive code modernization upgrades in the background.

## Rolling Updates

We perform infrastructure updates without bringing your site down. Our SLA is to provide 99.95% uptime per month. Any updates that might possibly cause any service interruption are performed at midnight PST.

## Security

The web should be secure by default. Hosting your site or api on Airship means you get 256-bit TLS encryption. You don't need to buy or maintain SSL certificates, Airship manages it for you.

## Site Speed

Users and search engine crawlers expect speedy load times. Airship renders your traditional html responses with sub 100ms delivery, allowing you to achieve the fastest pixel to glass, and ATF performance.

## Customization

If your project has specific use cases that Airship does not come with out of the box, you can include additional functionality in a few ways.
Airship can trigger webhooks to send https requests to your own servers when a Collection Item is created, updated, or deleted (including product collections and orders).
Your custom services can access the Airship API via https requests and an auth token to create, update, or destroy any Airship resource that the access token is allowed to access.

## Application Delivery

Focus on designing beautiful interfaces and simple intuitive user experiences. Leverage the workflow tools and customizable content management system that Airship provides so that you can deliver quality sites before your deadline.
