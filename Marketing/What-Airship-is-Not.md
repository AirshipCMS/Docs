# How to make your Project More [SOMETHING]
Airship is more than just a CMS. It is a development and hosting platform that allows a developer to build rapidly, in whatever stack they choose, and nearly any workflow they choose. How does this benefit you? Devs can develop faster, QA can review faster, Editors can create content, and the project can be completed more efficiently and cost-effectively. 

This doesn't mean that the project is _cheaper_, though it means you can spend more of the bucks building the website and application glamour... the stuff you really want to shine.

90% of building a project (any project) is nearly the same. Airship gives a developer schema creation tools to make it fast to scaffold a project infrastructure.

Double your Speed. Once the project schema is completed, the content of the project can be sent off to the content editor to work on, while the developers can work on the functionality. Isn't that better than waiting for the entire project to be completed, _then_ starting on final content?

If you are a user that is web-savvy, and likes to manage their own website with drag & drop tools, and lots of configuration and options, Airship CMS is not for you. You might be better off with a large enterprise solution, or a service with UI controls for flexibility. 

If you are a user that is on a budget, AirshipCMS might not be for you.  For DIY solutions take a look at --, --, and --.

We like to think that Airship is for building custom sites. :) Especially when you want to build a custom site, without the hassle of a custom CMS, and without the headache of battling a CMS made for blogging. Airship is especially for building uniquely crafted custom sites and projects, and a developer IS needed in order to exercise the full power of the platform.

If you are someone who is growing your business, and you are focusing on YOUR BUSINESS and expertise, and you are ready to call a developer so you can keep doing what you do, while devs can build something(what we are good at doing!!) then you are ready for Airship. Unlike DIY solutions, the user interface for business owners, shop owners (we know you have very little time!) is simplified and uncluttered. Things should be relatively familiar and hard to break. We keep the technical controls in the hands of the developers. All you have to do is call up your dev, and they can quickly customize your end project to your heart's content. If you are interested in _that_ kind of relationship/project, Airship could be a fit for you :)

Different because we Don't Give you a GUI.
What does Airship provide? A playground for developers to build. Unlike the solutions that exist out there, we _don't_ give you a GUI for drag and drop. Let's be honest... the 4 hours it would take you to "customize your site" will get you close, you will be 75% happy, and you could have used those 4 hours to do whatever your core expertise is... and just pay a web designer or developer to craft your site to your specifications. THat is the kind of relationship we are interested in.

Still there are cases where Airship ISN'T a good fit. And we need to address that.
Data heavy, requires websocks.
