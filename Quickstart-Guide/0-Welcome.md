# Welcome to Airship CMS!

We love efficiency! So we built a CMS focused on _developer workflow & simple deployment_ so we could get projects started instantly, developed quickly, and launched painlessly. 

This 10-minute Step-by-Step Guide will walk you through a stripped-down, simple development workflow using Airship CMS. Once you've mastered the basics, use a frontend dev stack and process that works for you! 

This Guide will walk you through the very basics of:
1. Provisioning your first Airship-hosted site
2. Setting up the command-line tools
3. Local development ("Landing" your project)
4. Using the Airship CMS online admin portal
5. Deployment ("Launching" your project)
