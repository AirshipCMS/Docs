# Welcome to Airship CMS!

We love efficiency. So we built Airship to be a CMS with a focus on developer workflow so we could get a project started instantly, developed quickly, and launched painlessly. 

Ready to get started? Test out the workflow with a demp project, to see if it works for your dev workflow. 

This guide will show you the very basics of:
- signing up for a developer account
- provisioning your first Airship-hosted site
- setting up the command-line tools
- integrating Airship into your local dev workflow
- using the Airship CMS online admin portal
