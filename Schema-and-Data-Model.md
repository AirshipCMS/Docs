# Schema & Data Model
A project schema is the map of pages, collections and connections between those pages and collections. Be sure to study how [Pages](https://airshipcms.io/documentation/view/pages), [Collections](https://airshipcms.io/documentation/view/collections), and [Relationships](https://airshipcms.io/documentation/view/relationships) work before planning the schema of a project built with Airship.
