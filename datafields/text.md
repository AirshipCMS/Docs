The `text` field is a simple input. It's useful for content with small amount of phrasing, such as headers or titles.

Example markup using a `text` field with the variable name `header`:
```
<p>{{fields.header}}</p>
```

Example Output:
```
<h1>Cute Animals &amp; Products</h1>
```

Note: Only a `text` field can be set as a Primary Label.
