Be sure to use your actual subdomain wherever you see a reference to "mysite":

- `airship login mysite`

## 1. Create your site.
_Note: Airship is currently available by Private Invitation only. You won't yet be able to login at the developer portal. Request a [Test Pilot License](https://airshipcms.io/signup), and we will contact you when a seat opens up!_

Create a new Airship site at the Airship Developer Portal.

Once your site is provisioned, navigate to your project url `(https://mysite.airshipcms.io)`. It will look something like this:

## 2. Log in to your site.
Log in to the admin portal `(https://mysite.airshipcms.io/admin)` with your login credentials.

Keep this window open. You will need to access it later.
